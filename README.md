# ISCI 3A12 LUE Seminar 1: Planetary Formation

Hello ISCI 3A12! The following preparatory material is for your upcoming seminar on **Wednesday, February 28th 2024 at 4:30 pm (HH 305)**. In this seminar, we will be covering the specific steps to the classical theory of planetary formation, and how this hypothesis has changed in recent years due to Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and Kepler technologies. In order to prepare for the lesson. We have developed some short review materials, videos, and an assessment quiz to test your knowledge before the seminar. 

## Pre-Seminar Preparatory Materials
Use the following list to ensure you have all the necessary content for the seminar:
1. Watch the **introductory video** (ISCI 3A12>Channels>LUE)
      - Complete all activities within the video **(DUE: 2:00 pm on Wednesday, February 28th 2024)**
2. Read through the **content review and introduction** below
   - Includes links, videos, and summaries
3. Complete the pre-assessment quiz **(DUE: 2:00 pm on Wednesday, February 28th 2024)**
4. Download the **in-class seminar** worksheet (Note that handouts will be provided for those who do not have a tablet/fillable PDF extension)

Please take the time to thoroughly prepare and make sure you have all the required materials to get ready for an engaging lesson! <p>

## Introductory Video Review:

From the introductory video that was posted, you should have been able to understand the following topics:
- Understand all **relevant content from RP1**: The definition of an exoplanet, its naming conventions, Kepler’s laws, and what affects an exoplanet’s surface temperature
- An overview of the main detection methods and how they work in combination to **detect key characteristics of exoplanets**
- How exoplanets are **placed into categories**, including Terrestrial, Super-Earths, Neptune-Like, Mini-Neptunes, and Gas Giants. Notably, these categories are considered to be more of a spectrum
- A basic understanding of **planetary formation** through the nebular hypothesis, and key terms such as planetesimals and protoplanetary disk. 

As mentioned, this seminar will be focusing on the theories regarding planetary formation. Therefore, please make sure you are familiar with the topics pertaining to this discussed in the video. A recap of the steps discussed in the video were:

1. Stars form from the **gravitational collapse**  of a solar nebula.
    - As the radius of this cloud disappears, the rate of spin increases along with the formation of a disk of material, referred to as an accretion disk.
2. Through collisions of particles within the disk itself, **planetesimals are formed**.
3. Some planetesimals continue to accumulate to form larger planets, depending on **interactions with other planetesimals** within the disk.
4. Smaller accretion disks **form around these planetesimals** , leading to the creation of moons.
5. **More work remains** to further understand the formation of planets both within our solar system as well as outside our solar system.
